# Overview

In order for me to further my employment opportunities and abilities, I am trying to develop my skills by learning to create systems in new programming languages and develop my skills in the languages I already have experience working with. 

This is a simple "Hello World!" program written in Python. It also asks the user for their name, notes the date and time when it happened, then greets the user and says when they used the program.

This program was created to demonstrate a baseline in ability for creating programs in Python.

# Development Environment

When developing the software, I used Visual Studios Code as my code editor. I also used w3schools for syntax
help and Stack Overflow for help with syntax errors.

For the program's language, I chose to use Python.
